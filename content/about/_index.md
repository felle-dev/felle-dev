Hi, I'm Felle.

I spend most of my time typing at computers, hoping they'll do what I want. Sometimes they cooperate. Most of the time I'm convincing myself I understand what's happening under the hood.

I build things when I'm curious and break things when I'm learning. The line between the two gets pretty blurry. If something works, I probably got lucky. If it doesn't, well, that's just another opportunity to figure out why.

This site is where I document projects, write tutorials that are mostly notes to my future self, and occasionally pretend I know what I'm doing. If any of it helps someone else stumble through the same problems, that's a bonus.

Nice to meet you.
